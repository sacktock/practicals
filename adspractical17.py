"""
in the module Computational Thinking (CT) you will use the package
NetworkX to work with more complex graphs/networks, but in this module we will
only work with small graphs in order to illustrate the algorithms that we meet;
so we can represent them in python very simply

and in fact, in this practical, we will look only at the various ways of
representing graphs -- you will have the chance to implement Breadth-First
Search in CT

we will represent vertices by letters "A", "B", "C" etc. so we can represent
the whole vertex set by a string; for example

V = "ABCDEFGHIJKLM"

and we can represent each edge by a string containing two characters such as
"AB"; if the graph is undirected then "AB" and "BA" are different ways of
representing the same edge, if it is directed "AB" is an edge from "A" to "B"
and "BA" is an edge from "B" to "A"

for an edge array representation we will use lists; for example

E = ['AB', 'AC', 'AD', 'AE', 'BC', 'BF', 'BG', 'CG', 'CH', 'EI',
    'EJ', 'EK', 'EL', 'FL', 'GH', 'GI', 'GM', 'KL', 'KM']

or we can write

E = "AB AC AD AE BC BF BG CG CH EI EJ EK EL FL GH GI GM KL KM".split()

these are two ways of writing the same thing as the split function turns the
long string into a list of short strings; the spaces tell it where to break

for an adjacency list representation we will use a dictionary; the keys are
the vertices and the values are strings containing the neighbouring vertices;
for example

E = {'A': 'BCDE',
     'B': 'ACFG',
     'C': 'ABGH',
     'D': 'A',
     'E': 'AIJKL',
     'F': 'BL',
     'G': 'BCHIM',
     'H': 'CG',
     'I': 'EG',
     'J': 'E',
     'K': 'ELM',
     'L': 'EFK',
     'M': 'GK'}

finally for an adjacency matrix representation we use a list of lists; the jth
item in the ith list is 1 if there is an edge from the ith vertex to the jth
vertex; otherwise it is 0; for example

E = [[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
     [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
     [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
     [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]

then we can define a graph as a triple

G = (V, E, False)

where the third value tells us whether or not the graph is directed

below are three functions

array_to_lists
lists_to_matrix
matrix_to_array

which take as their input a graph defined with one of the representations and
return the same graph using a different representation; complete the functions
and call the test functions to check their correctness
